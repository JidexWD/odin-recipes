    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We loved drinking a little coconut rum cream in our morning coffee on vacation in Jamaica but could never find it when we returned home.
        After looking up several recipes, I decided to make some adjustments and came up with my own version. 
       Add a little to your coffee or serve over ice as a cocktail.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1(2.6 ounce) bar milk chocolate candy bar, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk </li>
        <li>1 cup dark rum</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons instant coffee granule</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coconut extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat cream and chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water,
            stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula until chocolate is melted; 
            remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>Blend together cooled chocolate mixture, 
                condensed milk, rum, coffee granules, cinnamon, vanilla, 
                and coconut extract in a blender on high speed until smooth.
            </li>
    </ol>
